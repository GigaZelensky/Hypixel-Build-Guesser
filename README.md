This static HTML website lets you input characters from a Hypixel Build Guesser game. The game shows the number of characters and spaces as underlines, revealing a random letter every few seconds. You can use the site to guess the word (e.g., 'a__p____' becomes 'Airplane', you can also use dots, e.g., 'a..p....'), the site shows the number of characters inputted and clicking on a result instantly copies it to clipboard.

Here is the site you can access directly as an preview of the html:
